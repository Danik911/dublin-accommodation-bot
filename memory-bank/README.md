# Memory Bank: Dublin Accommodation Automation Bot

## Purpose
This Memory Bank serves as a comprehensive knowledge repository for the Dublin Accommodation Automation Bot project. It ensures that all critical project information is preserved and accessible, enabling effective continuation of work across sessions and team members.

## Structure

### Core Files (Required)
These files form the foundation of project knowledge and should be maintained with precision:

1. **[projectbrief.md](projectbrief.md)**
   - Foundation document defining core mission and requirements
   - Primary objectives and success criteria
   - Target user profile and technical requirements
   - Project status and constraints

2. **[productContext.md](productContext.md)**
   - Why this project exists and what problems it solves
   - User experience flow and benefits
   - Success metrics and target outcomes
   - Market context and opportunity analysis

3. **[systemPatterns.md](systemPatterns.md)**
   - System architecture and component relationships
   - Key technical decisions and design patterns
   - Error handling and performance optimization strategies
   - Security and scalability considerations

4. **[techContext.md](techContext.md)**
   - Technology stack and dependencies
   - Development setup and configuration
   - Technical constraints and limitations
   - Deployment and maintenance requirements

5. **[activeContext.md](activeContext.md)**
   - Current work focus and recent changes
   - Next steps and active decisions
   - Current challenges and system health status
   - Development environment and user support considerations

6. **[progress.md](progress.md)**
   - What works (completed features and test results)
   - Current status and recent achievements
   - What's left to build (enhancement opportunities)
   - Known issues and performance metrics

## Project Intelligence (.cursorrules)
The `.cursorrules` file captures project-specific patterns, preferences, and intelligence that help AI assistants work more effectively with the codebase. It includes:
- Critical implementation paths
- User preferences and workflow patterns
- Known challenges and solutions
- Tool usage patterns and maintenance tasks

## How to Use This Memory Bank

### For New Team Members
1. Start with `projectbrief.md` to understand the core mission
2. Read `productContext.md` to understand why this project exists
3. Review `systemPatterns.md` for technical architecture
4. Check `progress.md` for current status and what's working
5. Consult `activeContext.md` for current focus areas

### For Ongoing Development
1. Update `activeContext.md` when starting new work
2. Update `progress.md` when completing features or finding issues
3. Modify other files when making architectural or strategic changes
4. Keep `.cursorrules` updated with new patterns and insights

### For AI Assistants
1. **Always read ALL memory bank files** at the start of each session
2. Use the information to understand project context and current state
3. Update relevant files when making significant changes
4. Refer to `.cursorrules` for project-specific patterns and preferences
