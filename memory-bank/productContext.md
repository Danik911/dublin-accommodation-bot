# Product Context: Dublin Accommodation Automation Bot

## Why This Project Exists

### The Dublin Housing Crisis
Dublin faces a severe accommodation shortage, particularly affecting international students who struggle with:
- **Limited Budget**: Student finances constrain rental options
- **Market Competition**: High demand for affordable accommodation
- **Geographic Constraints**: Need proximity to college and work locations
- **Time Constraints**: Manual searching is time-intensive and inefficient
- **Information Asymmetry**: Difficulty finding free accommodation opportunities

### The Free Accommodation Opportunity
Many Dublin residents offer free accommodation in exchange for:
- **House Sitting**: Property care during owner absence
- **Work Exchange**: Light duties in exchange for accommodation
- **Caretaking**: Property maintenance and security
- **Skills Exchange**: Language tutoring, technical help, etc.

These opportunities are often buried in general rental listings and require systematic discovery.

**Problem**: Manually browsing Facebook Marketplace for accommodation is time-consuming and inconsistent.
**Solution**: Automated systematic search across 50+ Dublin area locations with intelligent filtering.

### 2. Missing Free Opportunities
**Problem**: Free accommodation offers are scattered and use varied terminology, making them easy to miss.
**Solution**: AI-powered keyword analysis with confidence scoring to identify free accommodation opportunities.

### 3. Location Analysis Complexity
**Problem**: Evaluating commute times and transport options for each listing is tedious.
**Solution**: Automated distance calculations and transport scoring for work/college locations.

### 4. Personalized Communication Barriers
**Problem**: Crafting personalized messages for each host is time-intensive and requires local knowledge.
**Solution**: Template-based message generation with user profile integration and location-specific benefits.

### 5. Data Organization Challenges
**Problem**: Managing and comparing multiple listings across different platforms and formats.
**Solution**: Structured data storage with comprehensive analytics and export capabilities.
